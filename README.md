##Description
This is a set of different web pages styled after the five main layouts found on the web: mondrian, a featured item, a basic gallery, column flipping, and feature shuffling. Each layout uses media queries and was approached mobile-first, and performs well on mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.  

##Setup
Clone this repository. Then, open each project individually, and view their respective <code>index.html</code> pages in the text editor of your choice. Drag the index's tab into your web browser to view the site.
We encourage you to play with the size of your web browser's window to gain an appreciation of what media queries can do and how they provide flexibility for a site across platforms.
